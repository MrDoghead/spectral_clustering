# spectral_clustering
includes power method

run a toy example:

```
python3 algo.py
```

here is a log info `log.txt`

## Another version is from Andrew, its input has 128 size

```
python3 power_demo.py
```

## Issues

1. when given adjacency A1 (see it in algo.py), the result is probably wrong.

2. my algo converges a bit slow
