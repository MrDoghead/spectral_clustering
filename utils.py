    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The observations to cluster. It must be noted that the data
        will be converted to C ordering, which will cause a memory copy
        if the given data is not C-contiguous.
    n_clusters : int
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate.
    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        The weights for each observation in `X`. If `None`, all observations
        are assigned equal weight.
    init : {'k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape \
            (n_clusters, n_features), default='k-means++'
        Method for initialization:
        - `'k-means++'` : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean
          clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section
          Notes in k_init for more details.
        - `'random'`: choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
          for the initial centroids.
        - If an array is passed, it should be of shape `(n_clusters, n_features)`
          and gives the initial centers.
        - If a callable is passed, it should take arguments `X`, `n_clusters` and a
          random state and return an initialization.
    n_init : int, default=10
        Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of
        `n_init` consecutive runs in terms of inertia.
    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm to run.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Verbosity mode.
    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare
        convergence.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Use
        an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.
    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If `copy_x` is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
        before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
        introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
        the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
        `copy_x` is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if `copy_x` is False.
    algorithm : {"lloyd", "elkan", "auto", "full"}, default="lloyd"
        K-means algorithm to use. The classical EM-style algorithm is `"lloyd"`.
        The `"elkan"` variation can be more efficient on some datasets with
        well-defined clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's
        more memory intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
        `(n_samples, n_clusters)`.
        `"auto"` and `"full"` are deprecated and they will be removed in
        Scikit-Learn 1.3. They are both aliases for `"lloyd"`.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
            Added Elkan algorithm
        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            Renamed "full" to "lloyd", and deprecated "auto" and "full".
            Changed "auto" to use "lloyd" instead of "elkan".
    return_n_iter : bool, default=False
        Whether or not to return the number of iterations.
    Returns
    -------
    centroid : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Centroids found at the last iteration of k-means.
    label : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        The `label[i]` is the code or index of the centroid the
        i'th observation is closest to.
    inertia : float
        The final value of the inertia criterion (sum of squared distances to
        the closest centroid for all observations in the training set).
    best_n_iter : int
        Number of iterations corresponding to the best results.
        Returned only if `return_n_iter` is set to True.

    Notes
    -----
    The eigenvector embedding is used to iteratively search for the
    closest discrete partition.  First, the eigenvector embedding is
    normalized to the space of partition matrices. An optimal discrete
    partition matrix closest to this normalized embedding multiplied by
    an initial rotation is calculated.  Fixing this discrete partition
    matrix, an optimal rotation matrix is calculated.  These two
    calculations are performed until convergence.  The discrete partition
    matrix is returned as the clustering solution.  Used in spectral
    clustering, this method tends to be faster and more robust to random
    initialization than k-means.
